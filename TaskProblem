Python Data API Services Developer Challenge: Shared Document Store

As part of the hiring process, we would like you to attempt a time-boxed coding challenge project, focused on a RESTful API service rapid prototype development. In this challenge, you are to create an API that stores “digital documents” in “folders”. Folders or Documents can have one or many associated “Topics”, with short & long-form descriptors.

 

The challenge:

- Using Python 3.9, Django, and PostgreSQL

- Design a basic Docs Store System with the tables “Documents”, “Folders”, and “Topics”

- Communicate this design with enough detail another developer could implement it effectively

- Build the Restful API service such that you can operate on the resources

- Deploy to a free cloud hosting site such as heroku and send us a link to access the finished work

- Ensure to populate the service with enough representative sample data to demonstrate basic request functionality

- Example test case: As a front-end developer, I want to access in a single request all the documents in the folder “Customer Feedback” associated with the topic “SpekiLove!”

 

This challenge will provide us with a solid piece of coding work to meet over with our developers and get to know our mutual styles and expectations.

Please acknowledge receipt, let me know if you have any questions, and good luck!
